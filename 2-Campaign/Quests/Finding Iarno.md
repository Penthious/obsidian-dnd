Sildar learns that Iarno Albrek, a fellow member of the Lords’ Alliance, disappeared while exploring the area around Tresendar Manor about two months ago, shortly after arriving in Phandalin. Sildar asks the characters to investigate the manor and the surrounding area to find and bring back Iarno—or what’s left of him if he is dead. Sildar describes Iarno as “a short, dark-bearded human wizard in his thirties.”

In reality, Iarno created the Redbrands, installed himself as their leader, and took the pseudonym “Glasstaff” to conceal his true identity. (The Redbrands call him that because he carries a glass staff.) Once he learns the truth about Iarno, Sildar expresses a desire to have Iarno captured and transported to Neverwinter to face the judgment of a higher authority. Regardless of Iarno’s fate, Sildar rewards the party with 200 Gold Award for eliminating the Redbrand threat.

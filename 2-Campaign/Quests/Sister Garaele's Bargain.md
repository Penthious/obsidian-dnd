Recently, Garaele’s superiors asked her to undertake a delicate mission. They wanted to persuade a dangerous banshee named Agatha to answer a question about a spellbook. Garaele underestimated Agatha’s wrath when she attempted to approach the banshee.

Before she fled for her life, Garaele noted that the banshee spoke wistfully about the beautiful baubles she owned in life. Garaele needs an intermediary to bring Agatha a suitable gift—a jeweled silver comb—and persuade the banshee to tell what she knows about the location of a spellbook belonging to a legendary mage named Bowgentle. Sister Garaele believes that a character who pays obeisance to Agatha might be able to trade the comb for an answer. She offers the mission to the characters and will give them three potions of healing as payment for their efforts. If the party pursues this quest, see Conyberry and Agatha's Lair in chapter 3.

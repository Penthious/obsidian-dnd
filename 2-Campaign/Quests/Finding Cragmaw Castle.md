After recovering at the Stonehill Inn, Sildar Hallwinter establishes himself at the townmaster’s hall. As an agent of the Lords’ Alliance, his goal is to see Phandalin thrive and become prosperous. Therefore, he wants to find the lost mine of Wave Echo Cave and help the Rockseeker brothers put it back into production.

Sildar also encourages the characters to keep up the pressure on the Cragmaw goblins. He offers the party a 500 gold Award if they can locate Cragmaw Castle and defeat or drive off the band’s leader. Sildar suggests the party might find the castle by searching the lands around the Triboar Trail for more raiding parties (see the random encounters in chapter 3).

This weapon, known as Lightbringer, was made for a cleric of Lathander, the god of dawn. The head of the mace is shaped like a sunburst and is made of solid brass. The mace glows as bright as a torch when its wielder commands. While glowing, the mace deals an extra `1d6` radiant damage to Undead creatures.

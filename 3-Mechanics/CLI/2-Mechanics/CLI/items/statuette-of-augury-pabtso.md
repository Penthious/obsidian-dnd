# Statuette of Augury
*Wondrous Item, unknown (magic)*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

This gold statuette of an elf is worth 100 gp, and is imbued with divination magic. A non-evil creature grasping the statue can ask it a question and receive a telepathic response, as though the creature had cast [augury](/2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/augury.md). Once a creature has asked its question and received a response, it can never activate the statuette again.

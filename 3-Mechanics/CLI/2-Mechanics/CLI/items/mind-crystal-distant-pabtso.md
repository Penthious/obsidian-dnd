This gemstone contains a crystallized bit of spellcasting magic.

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action while holding the mind crystal, you can modify the spell in the way described below. You can use only a single mind crystal to modify the spell, and you can't use a mind crystal and a Metamagic option on the same spell. Once you use the mind crystal, it becomes a nonmagical gem worth 50 gp.

## Modify Spell

If the spell has a range of 5 feet or more and doesn't have a range of self, the spell's range increases by 100 feet. If the spell has a range of touch, its range becomes 30 feet.

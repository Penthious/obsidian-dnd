  "name": "Multiattack"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 21\
    \ (3d10 + 5) psychic damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it has the\
    \ [grappled](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) condition (escape\
    \ DC 17) and must succeed on a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw or have the [incapacitated](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated)\
    \ condition until the grapple ends."
  "name": "Tentacle"
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one [incapacitated](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated)\
    \ Humanoid [grappled](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by Voalsh.\
    \ Hit: 55 (10d10) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0\
    \ hit points, Voalsh kills it by extracting and devouring its brain."
  "name": "Extract Brain"
- "desc": "Voalsh opens a rift into the Far Realm, centered on a point Voalsh can\
    \ see within 60 feet of itself, and a tentacle lashes across creatures near the\
    \ rift. Each creature other than mind flayers within 30 feet of the rift must\
    \ make a DC 17 Intelligence saving throw, after which the tentacle disappears\
    \ and the rift closes. On a failed save, a creature takes 18 (4d8) cold damage\
    \ from the rift plus 18 (4d8) psychic damage from the tentacle and has the [stunned](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned)\
    \ condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much\
    \ damage only. A [stunned](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned) creature\
    \ can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect\
    \ on itself on a success."

"reactions":

    \ attack roll, potentially causing it to miss. Then Voalsh, along with any equipment\
    \ it is wearing or carrying, magically teleports up to 60 feet to an unoccupied\
    \ space it can see."

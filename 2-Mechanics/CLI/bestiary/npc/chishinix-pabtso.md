    \ and the rift closes. On a failed save, a creature takes 18 (4d8) cold damage\
    \ from the rift plus 18 (4d8) psychic damage from the tentacle and has the [stunned](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned)\
    \ condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much\
    \ damage only. A [stunned](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned) creature\

    \ an unoccupied space it can see."

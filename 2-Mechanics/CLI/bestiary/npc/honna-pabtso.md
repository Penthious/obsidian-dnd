- "desc": "When a creature that can see Honna's eyes starts its turn within 30 feet\
    \ of Honna, Honna can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw if Honna\
    \ isn't [incapacitated](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) and\
    \ can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is\
    \ instantly [petrified](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#petrified). Otherwise,\
    \ a creature that fails the save begins to turn to stone and is [restrained](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained).\
    \ The [restrained](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained) creature must\
    \ repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming [petrified](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#petrified)\
    \ on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until\
    \ the creature is freed by the  [greater restoration](/2-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md)\
    \ spell or other magic.\n\nUnless [surprised](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#surprised),\
    \ a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its\
    \ turn. If the creature does so, it can't see Honna until the start of its next\
    \ turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at Honna in the\
    \ meantime, it must immediately make the save.\n\nIf Honna sees itself reflected\
    \ on a polished surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, Honna\
    \ is, due to its curse, affected by its own gaze."

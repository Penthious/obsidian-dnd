- "desc": "Grandlejaw has five heads. While it has more than one head, Grandlejaw\
    \ has advantage on saving throws against being [blinded](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded),\
    \ [charmed](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#charmed), [deafened](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#deafened),\
    \ [frightened](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened), [stunned](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#stunned),\
    \ and knocked [unconscious](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#unconscious).\n\
    \nWhenever Grandlejaw takes 25 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads\
    \ dies. If all its heads die, Grandlejaw dies.\n\nAt the end of its turn, it grows\
    \ two heads for each of its heads that died since its last turn, unless it has\
    \ taken fire damage since its last turn. Grandlejaw regains 10 hit points for\
    \ each head regrown in this way."

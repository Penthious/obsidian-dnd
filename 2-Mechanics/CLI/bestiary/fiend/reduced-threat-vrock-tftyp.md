- "desc": "A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic spores extends out from the vrock. The\
    \ spores spread around corners. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC\
    \ 12 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned).\
    \ While [poisoned](/2-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way,\
    \ a target takes 5 (1d10) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A\
    \ target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the\
    \ effect on itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also\
    \ ends the effect on it."
